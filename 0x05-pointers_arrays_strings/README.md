# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

* All your files should end with a new line

* Your code should use the `Betty style`. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

* You are not allowed to use global variables

* No more than `5` functions per file

* You are not allowed to use the `standard library`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden

* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)

* You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples

* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `main.h`

* Don’t forget to push your header file

## what we should leard from these tasks

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [0](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) | Write `a` function that takes `a` pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`. |
| [1](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) | Write a function that swaps the values of two integers |
| [2](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) | Write a function that returns the length of a string. |
| [3](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) | Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. |
| [4](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) | Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [5](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) | Write a function that reverses a string. |
| [6](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) | Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| [7](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) | Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. |
| [8](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) | Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.<ul><li>where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed<li>Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space<li>The numbers should be displayed in the sameorder as they are stored in the array |
| [9](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) | Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`,including the terminating null byte `(\0)`, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. |
