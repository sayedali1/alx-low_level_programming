# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while `c`

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

* All your files should end with a new line

* Your code should use the `Betty style`. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## Tasks

| Tasks | Describetion |
| --- | --- |
| [0](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) |This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. |
| [1](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) | This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. |
| [2](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [3](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| [4](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [5](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| [6](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| [7](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| [8](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| [9](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. |
| [10](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits |
| [11](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. |
| [12](/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. |
