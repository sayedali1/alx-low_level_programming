# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists `C` `Algorithm` `Data structure`

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

* All your files should end with a new line

* Your code should use the `Betty style`. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

* You are not allowed to use global variables

* No more than `5` functions per file

* You are not allowed to use the `standard library`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden

* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)

* You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples

* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `lists.h`

* Don’t forget to push your header file

## what we should leard from these tasks

* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists

## Tasks

| Tasks | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [0](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c) | Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.<ul><li>Return: the number of nodes<li>Format: see example<li>If str is `NULL`, print `[0] (nil)` |
| [1](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c) | Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list. |
| [2](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c) | Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.<ul><li> Return: the address of the new element, or `NULL` if it failed |
| [3](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c) | Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. |
| [4](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c) | Write a function that frees a `list_t` list. |
| [5](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/100-first.c) | Write a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed. |
| [6](/0x12-singly_linked_lists/101-hello_holberton.asm) | Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line. |
